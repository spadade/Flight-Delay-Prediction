# Flight Delay Prediction

Assuming that we has been recently employed as the business analytics team for a major US airline and their first task is to analyze flight data from the previous year (2019) which can be used to predict flight delay. Their objective is straightforward -

## OBJECTIVE: 
Interpret 2019 flight data and build a model that accurately predicts flight delay to be used to decrease delay in 2020 and, thereby, increase customer satisfaction.
The business requirements of this objective will be to correctly interpret the raw data, clean and process that data, select and engineer relevant features, use those features to predict and fine-tune the chosen machine learning model, and interpret the results for use by the airline’s upper management and decision-makers. Following is Group 4’s full report and model.
